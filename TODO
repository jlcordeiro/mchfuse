* LookupDirectory is the wrong name, it searches for files (too?)
* Copy small files that get there in 1 POST (and do not require a PUT)

## Tested workflows:

[*] rsync new file
[*] cp new file
[*] cat to existing file
[*] cat to unexisting file
[ ] cat overwrite to unexisting file
[ ] rsync existing file
[ ] cp existing file
